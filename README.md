# PhotonLogRecvdFuncs
 

Logs most photon events received to your client in a readable formatt except the event that tells function position and the event that outputs speaking(not relevent to finding new exploits).

There is a way to read raw data received to your client but documentating the headers for most actions and figuring out the entire syntax of them each would take too long and who knows how efficient it would be for seeing what in game functions new exploits use to break the game.

This mod requires no updating, just some uncommenting and adding a place you prefer to output the logs
